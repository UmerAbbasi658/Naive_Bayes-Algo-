# Pima Indian Diabetes using Naive_Bayes Algorithm

Here i used python and its basic libraries which are as follow:
Numpy
Pandas
Matplotlib
Seaborn
SKlearn for having Naive_bayes 

In this we have several records of different patients and we have to predict which patient have Diabetes. Naive_Bayes basically works on probability and when there is a change in records it predict the testing data that which patient have Diabetes. We found that this model is in underfitting domain.
